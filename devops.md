# DevOps resources

* General
  * [Awesome sysadmin](https://github.com/kahun/awesome-sysadmin): a great, growing list of SysAdmin resources
    (A source of *inspiration* :wink:).
* Configuration management
  * [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com): a remote task and server configuration management tool. Pretty similar to
    [Chef](http://www.getchef.com) or [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source), but simpler
    -- its aim is different.
    * Playbooks:
      * A [galaxy of Ansible content](https://galaxy.ansible.com) provides a centralized place to search for resources.
      * [ansible-security](https://github.com/nickjj/ansible-security): a security-related Ansible playbook.
* Server monitoring
  * [Monit](http://mmonit.com/monit): A great monitoring tool for the services in one or more servers.
